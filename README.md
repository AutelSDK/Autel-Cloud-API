# Autel Cloud API
## Description:
    The launch of Autel Cloud API is primarily targeted at developers who do not require deep customization of apps,
    allowing them to directly use Autel Robotics' drones to communicate with third-party cloud platforms. This enables
    developers to focus on the development and implementation of cloud service interfaces.
